# windowsWallpapers
Setting this as a background/startup task or manually running it every week, will copy all the nice windows images that you see in your lockscreen into your images folder

This just copies the images that windows automatically downloads from the temporary folder that gets emptied out regularly, into your user images folder.

- It will only copies images that are at least Full-HD or larger
- The python script requires a few non-standard python libraries but it can be tweaked to not needing them, by just hardcoding the user name and/or disabling the check for image size

## IMPORTANT!!!
Windows-Spotlight needs to be enabled for the lock screen, so that the images in the original folder get updated frequently
