Setting this as a background/startup task or manually running it every week, will copy all the nice windows images that you see in your lockscreen into your images folder

This just copies the images that windows automatically downloads from the temporary folder that gets emptied out regularly, into your user images folder.

It only copies images that are at least FullHD or larger
